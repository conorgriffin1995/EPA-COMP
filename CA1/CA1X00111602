EPA CA1	Conor Griffin	X00111602

Q1.
First change to /usr/bin

cd /usr/bin

then enter the command..
 
ls -al

Q2.
The user epa has been denied access to this folder because the permissions are set so that no users can access the Downloads folder.
A soultion to this is to change permissions by entering the following command

chmod u+x Downloads

Q3.
The problem here is a variable $1 is set to be passed in when running the script.
If a variable is not passed in when running the script you get an error because an variable is expected.
The solution to this is to pass in a variable like so,

./cpu_count.sh 1

O4.
pwd | wc /home

Q5.
The problem here is $dirA has been set to a string not an integer,
in order for this expression to work we mist change the operator in the if statement on line 6 to test if a string is equal to another string not an integer.
line 6 must be changed to = operator.

if [ $dirA = $dirB ]
